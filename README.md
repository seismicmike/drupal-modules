# Sample Drupal Modules and Other Code

This repository is just some sample code that I put up there to show off what I can do. As of 7/19/2016, this is still a work in progress, so please don't judge its incompleteness too harshly.

## Modules in this Repository
 * sm_form - Complete.
 > A sample form API form built using an Oject Oriented approach. Submitting the form saves the submission in the database and e-mails it to a user configurable recipient.
 * sm_employees - Incomplete.
 > Will be an Employee Database based on a Custom Entity with a CRUD UI based on Views and Views Bulk Operations.
 * sm_timesheet - Incomplete.
 > A time keeping system built entirely on Entities, Entity References, Views & some custom ajax/javascript
