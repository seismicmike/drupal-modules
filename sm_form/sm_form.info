name = SeismicMike Form
description = A simple form with some basic validation that stores the data in a database table and e-mails it to a configured recipient.
core = 7.x
version = 7.x-1.0

; I am using the xautoload to enable PSR-4 autoloading of my Submission class,
; which is available via the PSR-4 namespace Drupal\sm_form.
dependencies[] = xautoload

; Alternatively, I could skip xautoload and have Drupal's autoload system load
; the class by listing it here:

;files[] = src/Submission.php

; Or as I've more commonly seen in Drupal modules, but is not PSR compliant:

;files[] = sm_form.submission.inc

; Or

;files[] = includes/sm_form.submission.inc

; This would not, however, give me the benefit of namespacing, so I would have
; to name my class something ridiculous like SeismicMikeFeedbackFormSubmission
; or something like that. No thanks. I just prefer clean code and best
; practices as much as possible.
